#   To demonstrate capabilities of the chip in a user perceivable manner,
#   this layer of software is responsible for
#       -# integrating relevant groups and modules
#       -# selecting appropriate confilgurations for different modules
#       -# building into an executable and evetually executing on the on-chip processor
#       -# Incorporating any additional tasks, as needed, to control the behavior of the system
#       .
#
#   Configuration includes both build time and runtime configurations. Applications
#   are also responsible to take appropriate actions based on input events like
#       -# link up/down notifications starting/stopping the media system (in applicable platforms)
#       -# controlling switch functionality based on link up/down or dataflow monitoring
